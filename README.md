# yshard

A simple application that takes a yaml document as input and splits it into separate files, doing a GROUP BY on the user provided json path. This can be useful in cases where large complex packages are distributed as a single yaml file containing multiple yaml documents, as is often the case for kubernetes manifests. This also often happens when the yaml document has been auto-generated by a templating tool. 

# Getting Started

# Implementation

This CLI is built in Rust, based on [rust-starter](https://github.com/rust-starter/rust-starter). It largely relies on jq-rs for the json manipulation.
